## My Kickstarter Advice

* If you release a trailer for your game and it gets less than 5000-10000 views, do not do a Kickstarter.

## Poncho

* DO NOT QUIT YOUR DAY JOB.
* Design something that's simple, you can still make a big game, but make sure the design is concise.
* If you ever get this feeling: "Meh, it's good enough, let's just release and be done with this hell". Wait. You will regret it, even if you're on the brink of homelessness and need money, suffer through it and wait. It will be worth it.
* You probably won't make much money. Don't risk your finances for years by going into debt and putting all your chips in.
* DO NOT RELEASE IN NOVEMBER.
* Publishers aren't always going to magically get people talking about your game. If that's the reason you have for getting one, don't.
* Porting from PC to console is not the same as porting from PC to Mac or mobile in Unity. It's a lot of work.
* Game expos and watching other people play your game is key to making your game better, as well as making you a better designer.
* DO NOT DO GIVEAWAYS. You'll get emails all the time from people saying they'll market your game by giving it away. Even if you've only sold a few hundred copies, it's not worth it. It won't benefit anyone but the person doing the giveaway.
* If you do a kickstarter video, make sure it has you, the developers, in the video.
* DO NOT GIVE KEYS TO YOUTUBERS WITH LOADS OF SUBSCRIBERS WHO REQUEST IT. If you get a request from a you tuber who has a million subscribers, that should raise a red flag. Popular youtubers do not request keys. If you give them a key, your game will be all over torrent and pirate sites within a week.
* Getting on board with consoles is much easier than you might think. It literally takes a few emails usually to get access to dev kits and software to develop for consoles if you have a good game.
